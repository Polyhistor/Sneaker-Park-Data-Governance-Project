# Master Data Management Architecture for Sneaker Park

The ideal MDM architecture for SneakerPark at this stage can be the conslidation. This architecture has a medium level impact on the current state of affairs. Having systems only flowing data into a centralized MDM hub, and then applying standardization rules is an achievable target considering the current scale of the company. This architectures introduces a moderate level of complexity to current state architecture, introduces good level of data governance, and allows for better data accuracy and consistency.

While registry MDM architecture could be a good start too, it would not be as effective. This is due to the fact that registry MDM introduces the risk of metadata being in a false positive state. On the other extreme, a centralized MDM architecture is too big of an investment for a business like Sneaker Park, and takes substantial measures to materlize.
